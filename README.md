# DailyWins

DailyWins is an application inspired by the book The Gap and The Gain. It is said that what you do during the 60 minutes before bed has an enormous impact on your sleep quality, as well as the direction and quality of your next day.

By writing your daily wins before bed, it will be a form of reflection of what you did in that day. As Pearson's law states, when performance is measured, performance improves. When performance is measured and reported, the rate of improvement accelerates.

# What is this built on?

For deployment, this application is run using **pm2** inside a VPS. Reverse proxy is done using **Caddy**.
